# Face Recognition

This project was developed for the Description and Retrieval of Audiovisual Content course at Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya. The purpose of this project is to implement a face recognition system. Three types of high-level features were extracted: histogram, 2D DCT and HOG and the kNN algorithm was used to classify the results.

## Installation
To install and run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/bianca-ghx/face-recognition.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd face-recognition
    ```

## Usage
To use the face recognition system, follow these instructions:

1. Ensure the image data is in the correct format.
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook provided in the repository:
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook face_recognition.ipynb
    ```
3. Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess the data, extract features, and train the kNN classifier.
4. The extracted features can be visualized the features using the `features_visualization.ipynb` notebook.
